### Bashi For-Hire Program: <a href="#bashi-for-hire-program" id="bashi-for-hire-program"></a>

Earn BVX tokens while you sleep! See Fair Draft Colosseum in **PvP Mode**. Owners of Bashis can list their Bashi NFTs as **“For-Hire''** in the Bashi Colosseum transforming them into playable mercenaries by players around the world. **If another player drafts the Bashi For-Hire, the owner of the Bashi is then rewarded a percentage of the loot and bounty earned by the primary player(s) of that match after results are settled. **&#x20;

This is a key focal point of the project’s development as it grants access to the complete experience of the gaming aspect of BashiVerse allowing participants to experience the game to its maximum potential (with little to no upfront cost). Players will be able to play and utilize some of the rarest and most OP Bashis that will likely be extremely difficult to obtain for most. It gives players who may not have the resources or time to play, a new way to participate in the ecosystem and tell tales of the promised land in a legendary community.
