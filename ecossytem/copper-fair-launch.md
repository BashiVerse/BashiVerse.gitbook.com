# Copper Fair Launch

More than your average play-to-earn, BashiVerse is galaxy encompassing a re-imagined and fully animated 2D auto battle arena side-scrolling thriller!

We are leveraging our experience in software and indie game development by taking the best aspects of the MOBA / RPG games we play and love, compile the key mechanics that makes them addicting and gratifying to play, then building it from the ground up and building it to achieve the ideals of the decentralized promise. Simple as that.

We see a future abundant of gamers and creatures in the Megaverse because it simply isnâ€™t a fad or trend that comes and goes. Regardless of whether it is crypto winter or bull market summer, there will always be demand for a truly good and replayable game.

Enjoyment will take center stage over simply playing to earn because us hardcore pc-gamers have lived through 3 eras of traditional gaming upheavals where the most rewarding experiences among popular titles created by underdogs have somehow managed to rise to the top, all by adhering to the tried and true principles of community, community, and yes, COMMUNITY first!&#x20;

A vast and plentiful galaxy of dynamic gameplay as well as meaningful character progression through a well thought-out and beautifully-designed set of unique adventures await... <mark style="color:purple;">**We are not building to be the next Axie, we are building an evolution of Web3 gaming.**</mark>&#x20;
