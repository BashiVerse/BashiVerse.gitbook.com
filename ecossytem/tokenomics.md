# Tokenomics

The medium which powers the play-to-own ecosystem must be well-distributed and carefully designed. We believe that any serious Web3 gaming ecosystem should have the majority supply of its token sealed and attainable only via playing, staking, and or participating.

### BashiVerse Token $<mark style="color:purple;">BVX</mark>

The BashiVerse Token (BVX) serves as the primary currency for the BashiVerse with a total supply of 1,337,000,000. In order to ensure the steady development and completion of the Megaverse, we structured its allocation and strict issuance rates to disproportionately favor and reward those in the community who participate early and participate often.

### Linear Distribution & Majority Supply for Winning / LP Staking

A simple and transparent unlock schedule coupled with supply allocation heavily towards skill-based and genuine participation on linear vesting schedules allows us to focus on building the game and delivery without any uncertainties regarding token supply.

### Token Distribution Model

Full Unlock Schedule 2022 - 2028

Seed Round: 5% (linear release over 24 months)

Fair Launch Auction: 10% (instant unlock)

Staking LP Rewards: 20%

Play to Earn: 35%

Ecosystem Growth Fund: 10% - 3 month cliff (lockup after token FLA, then 2% unlock over 3 months followed by 36 months of linear vesting)

Team: 20% (1 year full lock, linear / 2 yrs)

### **Ecosystem Growth Fund**

The ecosystem fund will be managed by the Bashi team multisig council and board, and its core purpose is to grow the BashiVerse community.

We will be using the funds for the following types of activities, including (but not limited to):

* Rewarding and hiring extended team members (non-core team) such as third-party contractors and player ambassadors.
* Providing the community with giveaways and rewards on social media or by way of contests.
* Bonuses to non-core team members, such as our discord moderators.
* Incentives for other community members outside of the team as rewards for outstanding community engagement and support.
