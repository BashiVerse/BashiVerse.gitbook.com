# Bashi Leveling & Scaling

### In-Game Bashi Leveling & Character Progression

Your Bashi army units start at Level 1 at the beginning of the match. They gain varying amounts of experience points XP per kill, damage dealt, or allies supported (via support abilities) and can reach a maximum level of 10 which ultimately unlocks all active and or passive abilities they may possess along with their maximum stats potential.&#x20;

Each level unlocks an Bashi's stats gain such as hit points and defense as well as total mana.

Different abilities unlock at different levels. This will be the majority of our focus in the initial development and subsequent experience upkeep / improvement of BashiVerse (through community driven patch updates) as it is paramount to have a well-balanced matchmaking mode where the overall gameplay and integrity of fair play isn't compromised by distasteful power-creeping that many other games have suffered from.

### On-Chain Individual Statistics Range and Power Levels

Each Bashi will have its own set of stats such as max [<mark style="color:purple;">**fusion coun**</mark><mark style="color:purple;">t</mark>](../ecossytem/bff-and-bashi-minting.md), maximum HP, attack damage, luck, and accuracy for example within a spread range of base to +25% at its peak. All of these aspects of the NFT will be recorded on the metadata level which are NFT-bound and accessible through an owner's wallet or unique account within the game. Playing through and scaling up one's Bashi stats range is the on-chain aspect of progression. Each Bashi NFT will have a power level metadata trait to help users identifier the relative strength of their Bashi(s).
