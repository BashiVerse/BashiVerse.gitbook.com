# Bashi

Each Bashi represents an indivisible, 1 of a kind NFT that is <mark style="color:purple;">**playable,**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">**interactable,**</mark> and [<mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**scalable**</mark>](bashi-leveling-and-scaling.md) <mark style="color:purple;">\*\*\*\*</mark> in the BashiVerse. A galaxy of uniquely crafted Bashis where each trait or component serves a special purpose on its own i.e. elemental typing, attack damage, defense, stats, auras, and active abilities collectively fused into extraordinary collectibles that their owners can use to traverse through the game, raid, and duke it out in action-packed skirmishes to earn loot and precious BVX tokens.
