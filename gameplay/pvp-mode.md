### Ranked Ladder - Play for Keeps

Up for grabs are bragging rights, a little bit of ante, and the ability to flex. Players faceoff against other players by selecting from their digital wallets and assembling the ideal Bashi Squad in a rank-ladder calibrated match with visible match wagers along with enemy squad power levels.

\*\*Wagers are optionally and will primarily consist of non-marketable in-game items that players would normally loot and obtain from various levels in solo-player campaign (PvE) mode as well as booster packs.

A pool of Bashi NFTs are created via incentivized provisions offered to all Bashi NFT owners. See [<mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Automated Scholarships**</mark>.](../ecossytem/automated-scholarships.md)

Similar to booster drafting for various trading card games such as Magic the Gathering, Yugioh, and Hearthstone, players are given a randomly selected pool of Bashis and take turns banning and drafting Bashis from that pool to build the ultimate battle squad for the match.

Free to play with no NFT requirements. Rewards allocation and anti-inflation mechanism are achieved by the limited 10,000 colosseum battles that each Bashi NFT can endure before they are **“retired”** from the battlefield rendering them unusable in future Fair Draft Colosseum matches.

Retired Bashi NFTs may still be used in every other game modes and have the mutual benefit of somebody else upgrading them for you, unlocking their <mark style="color:green;">**earnings multiplier**</mark> many cosmetic and improved gameplay experience that come with these unique Bashis without grinding it out yourself!

### Global Ranking System

Winning a match will increase a player’s MMR or ELO in the global ranking system which will eventually serve as one of the qualifying metrics for the treasury sponsored eSports tournaments.

Each player's account will be tied to their unique digital wallets hence their profile, stats, and rank.
