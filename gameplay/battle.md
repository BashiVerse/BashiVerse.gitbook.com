### An Infinity of Input and Outcomes

One of the main reasons why we've elected not to launch the Bashi NFTs first is because they are meant to be functional, well-balanced and valuable in-game assets with a plethora of build and playstyles as part of the greater experience of the game. We are building them to enable millions of possible variable outcomes as well as balancing them to achieve a fair-play system so that <mark style="color:purple;">**the user ultimately is the X factor**</mark> behind having squads of weaker Bashis triumph the opponent squads of stronger Bashis on paper. This is what drives us to develop this exponentially compounding factor for the game as we expect to have many crunch development work weeks in order to achieve this milestone.

![This is a work in progress as the final game level will include modules and interfaces for in-game resource management, skill leveling, and unit placement grid along with enemy base structure buildings.](<../.gitbook/assets/battle screen.jpg>)

We aim to create gameplay that is simple enough to be enjoyed in a passive playstyle while also possessing the depth, complexity, and richness in strategies to be mastered to a player's maximum skill capabilities.

1. Match starts with a team units draft. Players pick a squad of 5 Bashis for battle.
2. Each Bashi has a gas bounty (the game’s fuel) amount that they award to the opponent or “feed” upon KO.
3. Using the required amount of gas, players may elect to upgrade certain aspects of Bashis within their base.
4. A sequence of rounds take place where players watch their Bashis duke it out with up to 5 powerful active ultimate abilities ready to fire at their fingertips.
5. Games are won by destroying the enemy base or after roughly 20 rounds of duking it out(\~15min), the player with the best KO score is victorious.
6. Players can either formulate strategies or simply set Bashis to auto-spawn / auto-cast and afk steamroll through the enemy’s base or get completely annihilated by some tryhards who will spend countless hours theory-crafting to outpace the meta. Either way, there will be action and lots of it!
