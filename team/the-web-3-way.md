# The Web 3 Way

Optimize for user experience, and go for mass onboarding is our MO.

### Why 2D over 3D?

In software development, design isn't the way in which a product looks but rather the feel and impression of the overall user experience and interface. In video game development, both superficial and integral aspects are weighted equally in terms the quality of the product because while software are a means to an end, video games are the ultimate end goal activity. Teams building in 2D can focus heavily on perfecting gameplay mechanics and story telling which are ultimately what makes for a truly good game at the end of the day.&#x20;

We are no strangers to building  and modding games as we are well aware of the perils and outrageous promises made by some of these Indie-game studios promising awesome 3-dimensional metaverse(s) to their audiences. We are far too familiar with traditional AAA titles that promised the moon and burn through hundreds of millions in development budget only to fall flat on their delivery with these "rekt" launches for lack of a better term. There a few key reasons for this phenomenon in the industry despite having the some of most talented developers embracing the dream and tackling these issues. For starters, building a truly immersive and fluid 3D experience is incredibly resource-intensive and often beyond the scope of a studio's anticipated budget. The other reason stems from some of the most recent notorious disastrous AAA title launches namely Mass Effect and Cyberpunk 2077 highlighting general team mismanagement due to the sheer scale of the project as well as unforeseen technical limitations within the gaming market as a whole.

Below is a set of user data collected from one of the largest PC games distribution platform indicating the percentages of individual GPU hardware by their relative market share which may help to explain part of the challenges facing some of these mega projects.

&#x20;These numbers suggest that a majority of PC gamers are still using hardware from the previous 2-3 generations as a result of either a worldwide shortage in supply, the high cost barrier to upgrading, or both. Most consoles have graphical processing capabilities below that of many PC components listed. 3D metaverses are meant to be social which means tons and tons of unit / player interactions in order for the experience to remain lively and well, social. Older GPUs suffer from the lack of vRAM which is the total memory and processing capabilities required to calculate and or maintain a steady and visually acceptable frame rate.

### An Unequal Cross-Platform Experience in 3D

Crypto especially gaming in Web3 takes place on an international stage. One can take an educated guess regarding the probability that the rest of the world especially in less affluent nations, that the level of modern generation hardware is no where near that which is available to first world countries. Thus there is a massive gap in experience delivered in these graphically-demanding "3D metaverses".&#x20;

There are a few things worse than playing through a session of play-to-earn while having to endure a potential sub-30 frames per second ordeal plagued by occasional screen stutters in what would be better classified as a slideshow rather than gameplay. What's worse is the inevitable in-game crashes that would occur during runtime due to previously stated hardware limitations. Not to mention a potentially fractured community as a result of unrelatable cross-platform experiences i.e. PUBG vs PUBG mobile and Fortnite vs Fortnite mobile. Those titles in comparison to their respective mobile counterparts are NOT the same. Players do not share a similar experience for what was intended to be the same game or world and these communities of different platforms often times bicker over inconsistencies from game-balancing patch releases that inevitably buffs or nerfs one platform over the other. 2D games if done right, can have a universally addicting experience across all platforms.

### Conclusion

We understand the scope of developmental labor that is required to successfully deliver and we are realistic with our set expectations for the game. We have a complete arsenal of creative tools and know-how as well as familiarity with building on Unity's game engine that allows us to create a truly kickass 2D experience limited only by our wildest imaginations for producing potentially the next major hit in competitive multiplayer arena genres.
