# Roadmap

We do not take any opportunity or privilege to build a great product for granted. We understand precisely what the project demands of us as we have a clear purpose to execute. After several weeks of building out Bashi’s database for Bashi’s gameplay mechanics, we drew up newer and what appears to be more clever ways of building incentive structures within the current gamefi ecosystem on top of a pretty addicting game. We hope you are as excited as we are in our departure from web2, fueled by our restless endeavor to realize the grand vision!

The Megaverse awaits…

## 2021 EOY - Genesis

The spark that ignites the BashiVerse drive and the jet fuel that blasts our project off into development. We will launch Bashi Core Token (BVX) via fair launch auction to secure the initial raise in order to streamline full-time development at warp speed.

## 2022 Q1 - Liftoff

As the BashiVerse continues to grow, we rally behind our community and seek to aggressively hire the best-of-the-best game and community building talents to assist and efficiently divide the current workloads that we foresee through many crunch weeks and months. The primary key hires will include an assistant 2D sprite animator to streamline the current creative director’s planned sprints in creating the game’s animation libraries along with quality assurance talent(s) to

A: ensure that everything appears and functions smoothly during runtime,

B: programmed in-game logic and sequence of functions are consistent and as bug-free as possible in deploying our first mvp, and last but not least,

C: the overall balance and gameplay experience of each match or level meets rigorous criteria that we set for addictive replayability.
