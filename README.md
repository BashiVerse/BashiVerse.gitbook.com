The black sun exudes vibrance beyond that of all horizons combined. Being neither a star nor planet, some call it the nebulous gateway serving as the bridge between our world and the high heavens, the digital galaxy of BashiVerse built with ❤ and courage by [<mark style="color:purple;">**Outer Heaven**</mark>](team/about-us.md).

A Dota and League-inspired Megaverse where anyone can earn precious tokens through various battles and adventure-driven gameplay or by simply interacting with ecosystem.

Picture the spectacular team fight aspects of MOBAs and RTS games such as StarCraft, Dota 2, and League of Legends playable at a casual pace, plus the mystery-fueled activities in Pokemon as well as the best of the best trading card games. Meaningful character progression and well-balanced luck-of-the-draw mechanics in ecosystem rewards are the two key guiding principles behind the conception of BashiVerse.

Immerse in a world of chance and fortune, where no two Bashis are the same, thus no two encounters or destinies are ever the same!

### Mission

We see a future abundant of gamers and creatures in the Megaverse because it simply isn’t a fad or trend that comes and goes. As web2 and most of IRL are shaping up to be this land of barren dreams and promises, more and more people will turn to video games & communities as an escape and haven to find or make meaning of existence. The only way out is in.&#x20;

Regardless of whether it is crypto winter or bull market summer, there will always be demand for a truly good and replayable game in web3. We are simply taking the best aspects of the games we play and love, compile the key mechanics that makes them addicting and gratifying to play, then re-imagining the process and playstyle into a less complex and easy to learn MOBA, enjoyable in single-player mode.

The key difference between BashiVerse and most of the top games currently available is that we are building it from day 1 to achieve the ideals of a decentralized future partially owned and operated by the players. **It is a game that we will also look forward to playing and earning from since 100% of the team's allocation will be subject to a 3-year lock up and vesting period.**&#x20;

Enjoyment will take center stage over simply playing to earn. We understand that gamers play not only to receive tokens but to also satisfy a sense of achievement through action-packed missions, challenges and problem-solving. Thus any serious p2e game must involve a system of character progression through a well thought-out and beautifully designed set of repeatable challenges in order to garner a meaningful and sticky userbase in the community. <mark style="color:purple;">**We are not building to be the next Axie, we are building an evolution of Web3 gaming. The end game is to establish our community in what will soon become the early days of Blockchain eSports.**</mark>
